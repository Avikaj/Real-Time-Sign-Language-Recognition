# Real-Time-Sign-Language-Recognition
Built to support communication accessibility, our system captures ASL gestures and converts them to readable text in real time. 


## The goal? 
To bridge the gap between the deaf/hard-of-hearing community and the hearing world.
We envision this tool being seamlessly integrated into classrooms, Zoom and Microsoft Teams meetings, and collaborative workspaces, making it easier to understand and communicate with others.

## ðŸ”§ Key components of our system:
â€¢ MediaPipe Holistic for landmark detection
â€¢ Transformer-based model optimized with TensorFlow Lite
â€¢ Tkinter web app for live and interactive demos
â€¢ Real-time gesture-to-text conversion with high accuracy and speed
